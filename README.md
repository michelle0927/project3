The object of the game is to get the player to the water at the top of the screen.

Keyboard keys to use:
up arrow - moves the player up one space
down arrow - moves the player down one space
left arrow - moves the player to the left one space
right arrow - moves the player to the right one space

Avoid the bugs! If the player touches one of the bugs moving across the screen, the player will be reset to the starting location.

Get to the water! When the player reaches the water, the score is increased by one, and the player is reset to the starting location to continue playing.

Have fun!
